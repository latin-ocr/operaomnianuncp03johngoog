Becket: for our J ohn, though surnamed of

Salisbury‚ was certainly never Dean of that
cityh.

Ι Ι take this opportunity ol noticing a criticism‚ which
appeared more than twelve months ago in the English ’
Rerierr, and which would have come with greater propriety
from the writer, if I had carried on the laboribus enterprise,
which at length, happily sor mysels, is concluded, for the
sake of pecuniary benefit. The Reviewer notices, with
